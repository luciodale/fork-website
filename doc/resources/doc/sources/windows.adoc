= Windows Prerequisites

Both WSL and Git Bash have been tested.

Under both of these, Windows-based editors will unfortunately be unable to jump to source.
This is a result of the JVM believing the path is /c/Users/User/foo.clj, but your editor looking for C:\Users\User\foo.clj.
There is no easy fix for this right now.
You can run your editor via WSL if it is terminal based though (e.g. vim / emacs), and that will work!

== WSL

Everything works under WSL.
You will need to install Java and run the Clojure Tools install script inside WSL.

=== Java

Open your Bash terminal.
You can find it by searching "bash" in the Start Menu.
Then type the following into the terminal:

[source,shell]
----
$ apt-get update
$ apt-get install default-jdk
----

=== Clojure Tools

1. Follow the Linux installation instructions at https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started 
2. Test that it works by typing `clojure`.
3. You now have a REPL (after some waiting), try `(println "Hello, World!")`.


== GitBash

=== Java

You will need to install Java onto your host machine.
You can download it from link:https://github.com/ojdkbuild/ojdkbuild[ojdkbuild] if you don't have it already.

=== Clojure Tools

You will need to provide a custom prefix to the Clojure Tools install script.
This means that you need to alter the instructions slightly, where they call `sudo ./linux-install...` you should also add `-p ~/clojure`.

Here's an example invocation, but ensure to check for the latest version at link:https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started[Clojure's Getting Started Guide].

.Example Invocation
[source,shell]
----
$ sudo ./linux-install-1.10.0.411.sh -p ~/clojure/
----

Next you will need to edit your `.bashrc` with lines like this:

[source,bash]
----
export PATH="$HOME/clojure/bin"
----

Test that it works by typing `source ~/.bashrc` followed by `clojure`.
Now you should be presented with a REPL, try your first evaluation: `(println "Hello, World!")`.
