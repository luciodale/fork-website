= Configuration and Components
Dominic Monroe <dominic@juxt.pro>

Edge comes with a few opinions.
It does this in order to provide the rest of Edge a mechanism for gluing together other parts automatically.

The main libraries which Edge has a hard dependency on are:

* https://github.com/juxt/aero[Aero], a config library
* https://github.com/weavejester/integrant[Integrant], a state management library

This guide will teach you:

* The basics of Aero
* The basics of Integrant
* How Integrant is integrated into Edge

It is useful to read their respective documentation, but the basics will be covered in this topical guide.

== Aero

Edge requires that your Aero configuration be named `config.edn` and is usually placed at `src/config.edn.` (but can be placed anywhere at the root of the classpath).
This file is a https://github.com/edn-format/edn[edn] file with some https://github.com/edn-format/edn#tagged-elements[tagged elements] defined.

Tagged elements take one form after them, so in: `#example 100` the `example` reader is called with `100`.
This is semantically the same as `(example 100)` in clojure.
A more complex example is `#example [100 "foo"]`, where `example` is called with `[100 "foo"]` (`(example [100 "foo"])`).
Tagged elements can take anything valid in edn, including vectors, maps, strings, numbers, symbols.
Tagged elements also nest, so you can do `#example [100 #example [20 "bar"]]` and that's equivalent to `(example [100 (example 20 "bar")])`.

Aero provides tagged elements for:

* Switching between dev, production and other profiles
* Referencing other information
* Reading environment variables and other external information

.`config.edn` using `#profile`
====

Here's a `config.edn` making use of `#profile`.

[source,clojure]
----
{:ig/system
 {:edge.yada.ig/listener
  {:port #profile {:dev 4000
                   :prod 3000}}}
----

`#profile` takes a map with keywords in.
If the map contains the currently active profile (in development Edge sets this to `:dev`, and in production to `:prod`) then that value will be chosen.

The end value of this config when read in `:dev` profile is:

[source,clojure]
----
{:ig/system
 {:edge.yada.ig/listener
  {:port 4000}}
----

====


.`config.edn` using `#ref`
====

`#ref` allows the config to refer to a variable defined elsewhere.
This is useful for de-duplicating repeated configuration.

[source,clojure]
----
{:web-port 4000
 :ig/system
 {:edge.yada.ig/listener
  {:port #ref [:web-port]}}
----

Aero will do a `get-in` of the top-level to find the key.
The above is semantically equivalent to:

[source,clojure]
----
(let [config {:web-port 4000}]
 (assoc-in config
           [:ig/system :edge.yada.ig/listener :port]
           (get-in config [:web-port])))
----

Finally, note that you can `#ref` to values which are tagged elements:

[source,clojure]
----
{:web-port #profile {:dev 4000
                     :prod 3000}
 :ig/system
 {:edge.yada.ig/listener
  {:port #ref [:web-port]}}
----

====

.`config.edn` using `#ref`
====

You may find that you need to read some information at runtime, such as the hostname or the port number for your application.
Aero provides the `#env` tag for this use-case.

[source,clojure]
----
{:identity #env HOST}
----

Will read in the `$HOST` environment variable and replace it.
If `$HOST` is `emerald` then this is what your `config.edn` will read as:

[source,clojure]
----
{:identity "emeralds"}
----

If you're working with a port number, it's useful to chain `#env` with `#long`:

[source,clojure]
----
{:web-port #long #env PORT}
----

This will first read as `{:web-port #long "4000"}`, and then to `{:web-port 4000}`.
====

There are many other useful tags in Aero, so we recommend you read the documentation if you find yourself needing more.

== Integrant

Integrant uses the concept of a "system"footnote:[Much like https://github.com/stuartsierra/component[component] if you are familiar that].
A system starts as a configuration map of keys and their configuration.
In Edge, your system configuration is under the `:ig/system` key in `config.edn`.

[NOTE]
====
In the default template `:ig/system` is a merge of two other keys.
The following documentation uses `:ig/system` as it's canonical, but you likely want to update `:ig.system/base` in your application.
====

.`config.edn` with simple system
====

[source,clojure]
----
{:ig/system
 {:adapter/jetty {:port 8080}}}
----

In this system, integrant know's how to `init` `:adapter/jetty`.
In this case, that would start a jetty web server on port `8080`.

====

Within a system, certain keys will depend on other keys, to support this you can use the `#ig/ref` tag. 
Unfortunately, this tag is deceptively similar to Aero's `#ref`, but has the following differences:

* `#ig/ref` is like `get`, but `#ref` is like `get-in`, so you use `#ig/ref :foo`
* `#ig/ref` is within the system only, it can't refer to the outer `config.edn`

.`config.edn` using `#ig/ref` tag
====

[source,clojure]
----
{:ig/system
 {:adapter/jetty {:port 8080, :handler #ig/ref :handler/greet}
  :handler/greet {:name "Alice"}}}
----

The use of `#ig/ref` in `:adapter/jetty` results in `:handler/greet` being started _first_, and the result being available to `:adapter/jetty` when it is started _second_.

[source,clojure]
----
(let [greet (init (handler/greet {:name "Alice"}))]
  {:handler/greet greet
   :adapter/jetty (init (adapter/jetty {:port 8080 :handler greet}))})
----

====

In Integrant, you can define how `init` should behave by link:https://github.com/weavejester/integrant#initializing-and-halting[extending a multi-method].

.Extending `ig/init-key`
====

[source,clojure]
----
(ns com.example.db
  (:require
    [integrant.core :as ig]))

(defn connect
  [uri]
  â€¦) 

(defmethod ig/init-key ::conn
  [_ {:keys [uri]}]
  (connect uri))
----

This will define a new `init` for `:com.example.db/conn` where it expects to take some configuration like `{:uri "db://localhost:8080"}`.
It would look like this in `config.edn`:

[source,clojure]
----
{:ig/system
 {:com.example.db/conn {:uri "db://localhost:8080"}}}
----

====

When defining a `init`, you must use namespaced keywords.
This allows Edge to automatically load the required namespaces. 
`{:ig/system {:foo.component/bar {:message "hello"}}}` will attempt to load `foo.component` and also `foo.component.bar`, missing namespaces are ignored.

Keys can also be vectors, this is a strategy for allowing duplicates.
In Integrant this is called a composite key.

.Using a composite key
====
[source,clojure]
----
{:ig/system
 {[:db/conn :com.example.db/users] {:uri "db://localhost:8080"}
  [:db/conn :com.example.db/orders] {:uri "db://localhost:8081"}}}
----

`:db/conn` is the actual component (there is a `(defmethod ig/init-key :db/conn)` somewhere).
But in order to allow connections (one for users, one for orders) we give it a second keyword to use.
====

When referencing a composite key, you should choose the non-generic name.

.Referencing a composite key
====
[source,clojure]
----
{:ig/system
 {[:db/conn :com.example.db/users] {:uri "db://localhost:8080"}
  [:db/conn :com.example.db/orders] {:uri "db://localhost:8081"}
  :my/handler {:db #ig/ref :com.example.db/users}}}
----

`[:db/conn :com.example.db/users]` is the key that will be passed into `:my/handler`, but integrant knows how to resolve just the specific part.

====

== Conclusion

You should now have a good grasp of the system in Edge.
