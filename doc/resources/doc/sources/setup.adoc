= How to build your own project upon Edge

Edge is designed to be built upon.
You are free to make whatever changes you like (additions and deletions), in accordance with the <<_license>> (MIT).

== Create a repository

If you don't have a remote repository already (e.g. on GitHub), here's how to create a new local one:

[source,shell]
----
src$ mkdir acme
src$ cd acme
acme$ git init
----

If you already have a repository, you can clone it like so:

[source,shell]
----
src$ git clone git@github.com:acme/acme.git
src$ cd acme
----

== Add Edge to your project

Once you have your repository, you can add Edge as a remote, and incorporate it in:

[source,shell]
----
acme$ git remote add edge https://github.com/juxt/edge.git
acme$ git pull edge master
----

== Add a remote later (optional)

It's a good idea to have somewhere to back up your commits.

For example, if you create a new repository on GitHub called `acme` under the organisation `acme`, you could add the repository to your project like this:

.Create a git remote
[source,shell]
----
acme$ git remote add origin git@github.com:acme/acme.git
acme$ git push -u origin master
----

== Create a new app

With your new project created, you're ready to create an app.
Apps are deps.edn projects within Edge which are intended to be run as a server.

From the root of the repo, run the `./bin/app` script.
It can be run with an optional flags which add support for Sass or Clojurescript, these are `--sass` and `--cljs` respectively.

[NOTE]
====
Your project name should be namespaced to match your application.
If your company was named "Acme" you might use "acme/api" or "com.acme/api".

If you're unsure, use your company name at work, or your github username for hobby projects.
There's a low chance of conflicts in an application.

The project namespace will determine the Clojure namespaces within your application.
====

[NOTE]
====
The below commands will create a folder based on your project name.
If you don't like the folder name, you can safely rename it (e.g. via `mv`) without any adverse affects.
====

[source,shell]
----
edge$ ./bin/app acme/api
edge$ ./bin/app acme/blog --sass
edge$ ./bin/app acme/dashboard --cljs
edge$ ./bin/app acme/radar --sass --cljs
----
